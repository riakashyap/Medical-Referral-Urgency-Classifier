Medical_Referral_Urgency_Classifier_with_UrgencyColumn.ipynb – This notebook uses a dataset with a dedicated Urgency column and performs classification from scratch using that label.

Medical_Referral_Urgency_Classifier_finetuning.ipynb – In this approach, there is no explicit Urgency column. Instead, urgency is inferred from the symptom descriptions using a fine-tuned DistilBERT model.
